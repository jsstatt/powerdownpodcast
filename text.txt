Power Down podcast is an all around every subject kind of podcast, sometimes random, mostly interesting, and laid back. Its enough to POWER DOWN from a long day. We started Power Down Podcast as a way to preserve in stone some of our most favorite stories, share them with friends and create more as we power through the hard times. This podcast seeks to enjoy all the little things in life and maybe brighten up a day or two. Tune in every week for a new episode of storytelling, shenanigans and a good time.
